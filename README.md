# API Test Automation Framework

This repository contains a test automation framework for API testing using BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) with Cucumber.js and Pactum.js. The framework allows you to write test scenarios in a human-readable format and execute them against different environments (e.g., prod, dev, qa) using environment-specific configuration files.
